Everything here revolves around flexibility: customizable kanban boards for any department, integrations with external companies and agencies, widgets that aren’t tied to a single screen — they live in Telegram, on websites, and even in third-party CRMs. This isn’t a platform, it’s an environment where business processes become your own, and possibilities keep expanding.",
            job: `Developed the frontend using Vue 3 / Nuxt and React for a B2B2C CRM system targeted at real estate developers. Was responsible for client-side architecture, built a custom component library, and established a consistent UI design language.<br>
            Created complex user interfaces focused on usability and performance — for both our clients and their end users. Migrated key modules to micro frontends and introduced a feature-sliced architecture (FSD) in the core of the product.<br>
            Fully designed, implemented, and brought to production one of the system’s core features — a <b>widget for developers’ and agencies’ websites</b>, including its backend part. It’s currently used by many developers and has processed over a billion rubles in leads.<br>
            Also developed an app for Bitrix24 integrated with the Ained Catalog product (a unit availability map for developers).<br><br>
